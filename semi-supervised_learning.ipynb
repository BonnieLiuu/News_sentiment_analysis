Adidas, Asics, Under Armour Spend $1 Billion on Fitness Apps. \"the fitness brands have been aspiring to have a relationship with the consumers early and establish an ongoing relationship with consumers,\" he said. that strategy can build more loyalty with customers, and buying an established app offers clothing and footwear companies a quicker way onto the market than building from scratch. \"people want to be connected, track their stats, update their records,\" said roger entner, a technology analyst at recon analytics. \"runners will be more loyal to the shoe brand if it also has all your stats. imagine the hassle to switch the data from one app to the next.\" roger kay, an analyst at endpoint technologies associates, said the shopping spree for fitness likely isn\\'t over.

      "[' paris, france -- on sunday morning, after luxury conglomerate lvmh announced that hedi slimane would take over at celine , the house posted a photo of its new designer on instagram with a simple and direct caption, complete with hashtags: \"hedi slimane named artistic, creative and image director of celine #hedislimane #celine #lvmh.', '\"for any other brand, such a gesture would seem normal.but this is celine, the women\\'s ready-to-wear house led for the past 10 years by phoebe philo , whose allergy to publicity and social media is widely known.the brand only began dabbling in social media in early 2017, when it launched its instagram account, and executing an e-commerce plan late last year.to \"ten years of work destroyed!!!\"', \"-- depending on whether the commenter's allegiance was to philo, the coco chanel of her generation who transformed celine from a once-middling label into a fashion authority, or slimane, the former dior homme and yves saintlaurent maestro whose ability to drive spectacular commercial results is polarising, yet unmatched.the rationale for slimane's appointment at celine is clear: lvmh has big commercial ambitions for the brand and the group's chairman and chief executive bernard arnault has reportedly sought to win back slimane since he exited dior homme, also owned by lvmh, in 2007. now, as celine approaches eur1 billion in annual sales, the arrival of slimane (who is set to launch new categories including menswear, couture and fragrance) alongside a more robust digital strategy and new stores (there are currently 150 globally) could help to double that figure.fragrance, if executed correctly, could be a billion-dollar business in itself.\", \"(in the first three quarters of the 2017 fiscal year , sales at the brand, whose current creative director anthony vaccarello has managed to evolve the label without abandoning slimane's vision, were more than eur1 billion, up 25 percent from 2016.\", ')but just how slimane will go about repeating this success at celine is complicated.celine\\'s history is not as rich or storied as that of yves saintlaurent (or dior).founded in 1945 as a made-to-measure children\\'s shoe business -- identifiable by its red elephant logo -- founder-designer celine vipiana pivoted the business in 1960 to focus on women\\'s sportswear, finding a following with the french bourgeoisie.philo\\'s success at the house, which she completely revamped, had virtually nothing to do with celine\\'s past.she carried on with few memorable signatures to rely upon, save for the abutting \"c\" logo and a horse-and-buggy motif, and re-imagined celine in her own, maximum-minimalist style, which has been seared into the hearts and minds of faithful celine followers (sometimes called \"philophiles\") around the world who quite literally bought into philo\\'s philosophy of a wardrobe for the modern woman.unlike saintlaurent, which was uneven both critically and commercially when slimane joined, leaving room for a sweeping reinvention, philo has loyal followers, many of whom could easily abandon the brand if slimane makes changes that are too extreme.', \"(the designer's weighty new title -- artistic, creative and image director -- indicates that he will have a significant amount of control over everything from product to stores to beauty.\", \")even though lvmh has already invested a great deal of money in building out the celine brand over the last 10 years, including its suite of about 150 retail stores, slimane will likely want to redo everything.still, it's also likely that he will find a way to reconnect with his own set of loyal customers, many of whom are still buying saintlaurent and dior homme.store buyers are generally enthusiastic, though the reactions of some have been more muted than others.\", '\"given the industry\\'s current appetite for designer shuffles, the news of hedi slimane to celine is one of the most welcome and logical new pairings,\" said linda fargo , fashion director at bergdorf goodman .', '\"losing phoebe was admittedly concerning at retail, but the news is a relief and gives us great confidence in the go forward.', '\"\"the move of hedi to celine is exciting and unexpected,\" said paolo de cesare, president of printemps.', '\"hedi has proven to be a \\'trendsetter\\' in the industry and it seems his creative mandate will cover all aspects of the brand, including the development of a men\\'s line and beauty.celine has done incredibly well with philo, and i\\'m convinced it will have a very exciting development in the coming seasons.', '\"\"this appointment was completely unexpected which makes it very interesting,\" said sebastian manes, director of buying and merchandising at selfridges .', '\"the addition of menswear is a very smart move specifically with the credibility of hedi in that category.', '\"\"whenever a fashion house makes a change in creative direction, we tend to see more interest and with slimane taking over celine\\'s helm, you can be certain that this will be the case,\" added tracy margolies, chief merchant at saks fifth avenue.slimane\\'s success at celine will depend, in part, on his ability to create an exacting core collection -- which at saintlaurent included the perfect chelsea boot, motorcycle jacket and pencil-thin jeans -- that appeals to the label\\'s current customers, while also layering on his own vision of celine.what\\'s sure is that slimane\\'s debut at celine will be the hottest ticket in town at paris fashion week come september.until then, the philophiles have one more season to fill their wardrobes.']\n",

that cracks in the building\\'s concrete had appeared and were growing in size; and that they feared for their lives.the managers replied that anyone refusing to enter the building would have their wages docked, not just for that day but for the entire month.in bangladesh, losing a month\\'s wages can mean starvation, so the garment workers were forced to climb the stairs to their work stations, gingerly stepping around cracks in the floor.an hour later, the eight storey building collapsed on itself, its illegally built top storeys shaken to bits by giant generators placed there to keep the factory running during frequent power cuts.unless the rights of garment workers and their unions are respected, it is only a matter of time until tragedy strikes again and mires the fashion industry in mud and blood.but in bangladesh, trade unions are all but outlawed and the country lacks even the most minimal workplace health and safety regulations, a sorry state of affairs that\\'s largely due to the fact that most of the country\\'s factory owners are also members of the bangladeshi government.amirul haque amir, president of the national garment workers federation in bangladesh (ngwf) explains: \"the owners of the factories are ministers, ex-ministers, parliament members, ex-parliament members, army generals, civil bureaucrats, even university vice chancellors -- this is the elite of society who have great influence over state mechanisms.', '\"this elite has been particularly terrified of trade unions since 2010, when the ngwf won an 80 percent increase in the country\\'s minimum wage.according to war on want, an independent anti-poverty group, however, bangladeshi garment workers are still only paid around ps25 (about $40) per month, whereas the costs of basic household necessities are estimated to be ps75 (about $120) per month.but before anti-unionism is written off as a uniquely \"bangladeshi problem,\" consider that in the aftermath of the rana plaza disaster, the british government held talks with 20 british retailers, whilst deliberately excluding unions, a vital part of the retail industry.lucky, then, that trade unions have taken things into their own hands.horror was widespread after the watershed of rana plaza, as consumers grasped the grim realities behind the \"made in bangladesh\" labels on their clothes.retailers who have admitted to using the rana plaza factory included benetton, bon marche, mango , matalan, primark and walmart, but hundreds more companies use low-cost bangladeshi factories, including upscale brands like armani, ralphlauren , michaelkors and hugoboss .sick of their warnings going unheeded, uni global union (which is comprised of 20 million members of 900 unions across 150 countries) and industriall (50 million members in 140 countries) capitalised on the outpouring of anger by serving retailers with an ultimatum.working with ngos and the ngwf, uni global union and industriall drafted the \"accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh\" and told retailers: this time, you sign our deal.it was a risky strategy.', '\"our members are the ones that sell these clothes,\" explains usdaw\\'s head of research and economics, fiona wilson.', '\"they are linked with workers in bangladesh; they care about what happens to these people and their families.', '\"the pressure campaign was a success.two days later, 35 retailers had joined the accord, which states: \"the undersigned parties are committed to the goal of a safe and sustainable bangladeshi ready-made garment (rmg) industry in which no worker needs to fear fires, building collapses, or other accidents that could be prevented with reasonable health and safety measures.', '\"today, the document contains the signatures of an impressive 87 retailers, including primark, new look, the n brown group and, as of september 12, sir philip green \\'s arcadia, owner of topshop.imagine what a difference this agreement would have made to the rana plaza workers who begged their managers for clemency on that fateful april morning.yet even with the implementation of the accord, there is an extremely long way to go until bangladeshi garment workers are fully protected and the country\\'s labour laws become consistent with international standards.bereaved families and disabled workers from rana plaza and tazreen fashions still await compensation.the workers rights consortium (wrc), an independent labour rights monitoring organisation, estimates that it would take $3 billion spent over five years to implement decent standards in bangladesh\\'s 4,500 factories.to those who worry about where the money should come from, consider that the five siblings of the walton family, which controls walmart, each have personal fortunes of $18 billion.we could start with them dedicating just 3.5 percent of their wealth to ensure that the people who slave for them do not die horribly in the process.unless the rights of garment workers and their unions are universally respected, not just in bangladesh, but across the world, it is only a matter of time until tragedy strikes again and once more mires the fashion industry in mud and blood.tansy e hoskins is a political activist, writer and the author of stitched up: the anti-capitalist book of fashion']\n",
